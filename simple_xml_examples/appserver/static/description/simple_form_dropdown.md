This example shows how to set search terms by populating a form with
one or more dropdown options.

The first dropdown is populated statically in XML, and the second
dropdown is populated dynamically based on the results of a populating
search. prefix and suffix tags formulate the search substring.

Both sets of dropdowns have a default value of `*`. The search
re-runs whenever a new value is selected. The panel title uses tokens to
reflect the dropdown selections.

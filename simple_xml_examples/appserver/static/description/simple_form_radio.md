This example shows how to set search terms by populating a form with
one or more sets of radio buttons.

The first radio button set is populated statically in XML. The
second radio button set is populated dynamically based on the results of
a populating search. It uses prefix and suffix tags to formulate the
search substring.

Both sets of radio buttons have a default value of `*`. The
searches re-run whenever a new value is selected. The panel title
uses tokens to reflect the radio button selections.

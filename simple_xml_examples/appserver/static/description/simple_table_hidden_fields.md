The table element enables users to specify the list of fields to display, which can be a subset of the full list of fields that are returned by the search.  These "hidden" fields are still accessible to users in the construction of drilldown behaviors.

The syntax for accessing these hidden fields is the same as all other fields, 
<code>$row.fieldname$</code>

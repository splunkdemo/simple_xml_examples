Trellis layout provides the ability to split a single search result to display a number of similar visualizations.


**Supports most visualizations**

- Apply a Trellis layout to any of the following native visualizations: Single Value, Column Chart, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Area Chart, Pie Chart, Choropleth Maps, Scatter Plot, Bubble Chart, Radial Gauge, Filler Gauge, Marker Gauge

- Trellis layout also works with Custom Visualizations, where appropriate. Developers can easily declare their visualizations to support Trellis layouts and enable the feature for their visualization.

**Data-driven number of trellis segments**

- If you are visualizing categories with ever changing values, Trellis layouts know how to handle this! Trellis layouts are data-driven, meaning that if you have different values for a field tomorrow (e.g. IP addresses), using Trellis layouts on a dashboard panel will automatically display appropriate values for a given time range, without having to hard-code them in SPL.
